# BEPUphysics

BEPUphysics is a pure C# 3D physics library by [BEPU](http://bepuphysics.com).&nbsp; It’s fast and has a bunch of cool features like constraints, terrain, static and instanced meshes, continuous collision detection, custom collision rules, vehicles, easy multithreading, yadda yadda yadda.

This repository contains the v1.X.X implementation of BEPUphysics that used to be hosted on [codeplex](https://bepuphysics.codeplex.com/). In the future, there will be another repository for the new v2.X.X implementation, which is pretty much a complete rewrite. Check out the [scratchpad repository](https://github.com/RossNordby/scratchpad) for some early bits and pieces.

The engine uses its own math libraries for cross platform development, and the demos rely on MonoGame.

Just starting out? Check out the [Getting Started](http://bepuphysics.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Getting%20Started&referringTitle=Documentation) tutorial in the documentation section.
